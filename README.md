# southbound
The website for the China Power Southbound Report
It is built using [Create React App Rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired) and [React Snapshot](https://github.com/geelen/react-snapshot)

Data is connected to a Google Sheet workbook in the China Power Google Drive folder. Triggering a new deploy runs the Google API via node write.js and updates data in src/app/charts.json
