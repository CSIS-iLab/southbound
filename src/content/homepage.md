        In a concerted effort to expand Taiwan’s presence across the Indo-Pacific, President Tsai Ing-wen introduced the New Southbound Policy (NSP) in 2016. The NSP is designed to strengthen Taipei’s relationships with the ten countries of ASEAN, six states in South Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The policy aims to leverage Taiwan’s cultural, educational, technological, agricultural, and economic assets to enhance Taiwan’s regional integration and promote the broader development of the Indo-Pacific region.

        The plan hinges upon forging a “sense of economy community” and forming “a consensus for cooperation” with the eighteen nations identified by Taipei as potential partners. Since Taiwan lacks formal diplomatic ties with the countries targeted by the NSP, Taipei must creatively foster bilateral collaboration. To this end, the Tsai administration has rallied local governments and civil society organizations to collaborate with the central government’s implementation efforts.

          Given the multidimensional nature of the NSP, its success should be evaluated incrementally. We encourage you to visit our <a href="/data">Data Repository</a>, which tracks several of the key performance benchmarks for the policy. More details regarding the NSP can be found in our longer publication.
